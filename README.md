#### Have you ever wanted to computationally solve the Schr√∂dinger equation of a Hydrogen Atom?
### No?
##### That's probably normal.

### The Goal
Let's set the stage: the end goal of this project is to generate visualization of the Electron "Orbitals" which many people will be familiar with from classes such as highschool chemistry.

#### A (very) quick crashcourse in Quantum Mechanics
Firstly, I should be very clear that I am NOT a physicist, meaning that this explanation I am about to give is based entirely on my own understanding of this subject (that likely has gaps) which I researched in order to complete this project :)
